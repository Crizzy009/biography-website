            <h1>Biography of David Baker</h1>
            <div class="left">
              <p>
                David Baker is an American biochemist and computational
                biologist whose work fundamentally changed how scientists
                understand and engineer proteins. He is a professor of
                biochemistry at the University of Washington and the founder and
                director of the Institute for Protein Design (IPD), one of the
                world's leading centers for protein engineering research.
              </p>

              <p>
                Baker is best known for creating Rosetta, a powerful
                computational platform that predicts protein structures and
                enables the design of entirely new proteins from scratch. Before
                his work, protein science largely focused on studying naturally
                existing proteins. Baker's approach showed that proteins could
                be rationally designed to perform specific tasks, opening a new
                era in biology. Early in his career, this idea was considered
                risky and unrealistic, and his research faced significant
                skepticism. However, through persistence and iterative
                improvements, Rosetta became a cornerstone of modern structural
                biology.
              </p>

              <p>
                His research has had wide-ranging practical impact.
                Baker-designed proteins have been used in vaccine development,
                cancer therapeutics, antiviral drugs, enzymes for industrial and
                environmental use, and biomolecular nanotechnology. Notably,
                Rosetta played an important role in rapid protein and vaccine
                design efforts during global health emergencies, demonstrating
                the real-world value of computational biology.
              </p>

              <p>
                In recognition of his groundbreaking contributions, David Baker
                received the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, honoring his role in
                establishing computational protein design as a new scientific
                discipline. Beyond his research, he is also known for mentoring
                a large community of scientists and for promoting open science,
                making Rosetta freely available to academic researchers
                worldwide.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, David Baker is regarded as one of the most influential
                figures in modern biochemistry, having transformed protein
                science from a descriptive field into a design-driven discipline
                with profound implications for medicine, technology, and our
                understanding of life itself.

                <h3>1. Computational Protein Structure Prediction</h3>
                <p>
                  Baker developed Rosetta, one of the first and most influential
                  computational tools for predicting how a protein folds into
                  its 3-dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence. This
                  helped scientists understand protein-structure relationships
                  central to biology and disease.

                <h3>2. De Novo Protein Design</h3>
                <p>
                  Baker's lab pioneered de novo (from scratch) design of
                  proteins creating entirely new proteins that do not exist in
                  nature. In 2003, his team used Rosetta to design Top7, the
                  first artificial protein with a novel structure verified
                  experimentally. This work opened a new field where proteins
                  can be tailored for specific functions like catalysis,
                  binding, or sensing.

                <p>
                  Rosetta has evolved over decades into a platform for both
                  prediction and design, and more recent work integrates
                  artificial intelligence and deep learning (e.g., tools like
                  RoseTAFold) to accelerate and refine protein modeling and
                  design.

                  Baker's lab has produced thousands of designed proteins with
                  practical uses: Proteins that neutralize viruses (e.g.,
                  SARS-CoV-2 binders), Proteins targeting cancer cells, Designed
                  proteins serving as enzymes, catalysts, vaccines, and
                  nanomaterials. His research contributed to development of the
                  world's first computationally designed protein-based vaccine
                  during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                  To expand research participation and computational power, his
                  group developed: Rosetta@home – a distributed computing
                  project that leverages volunteer computers worldwide for
                  protein folding/design calculations, Foldit – an interactive
                  online game where players help solve protein structure
                  problems. These tools democratize research and have
                  contributed meaniingful datasets to ongoing projects.

                <p>
                  Baker led the Rosetta Commons, a collaboration among many labs
                  worldwide to advance protein modeling and design software
                  development. Much of his group's software is open and widely

                  advances in protein structure, design techniques, and
                  applications. He has been awarded 100+ patents and co-founded
                  more than 20 biotech companies, helping translate
